A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples
isSquare(-1) returns  false
isSquare(0) returns   true
isSquare(3) returns   false
isSquare(4) returns   true
isSquare(25) returns  true  
isSquare(26) returns  false



/solution 


const isSquare = (n) => {

let squared = Math.sqrt(n)
return squared * squared === n && Number.isInteger(squared) ? true : false; 

}


Test.describe("isSquare", function(){
  Test.it("should work for some examples", function(){
    Test.assertEquals(isSquare(-1), false, "-1: Negative numbers cannot be square numbers");
    Test.assertEquals(isSquare( 0), true, "0 is a square number (0 * 0)");
    Test.assertEquals(isSquare( 3), false, "3 is not a square number");
    Test.assertEquals(isSquare( 4), true, "4 is a square number (2 * 2)");
    Test.assertEquals(isSquare(25), true, "25 is a square number (5 * 5)");
    Test.assertEquals(isSquare(26), false, "26 is not a square number");
  });
});
