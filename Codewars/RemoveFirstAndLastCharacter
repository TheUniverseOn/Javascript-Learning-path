It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last
characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.


const removeChat = (str) => str.slice(1, -1)


Test.describe("Tests", function(){

Test.assertEquals(removeChar('eloquent'), 'loquen');
Test.assertEquals(removeChar('country'), 'ountr');
Test.assertEquals(removeChar('person'), 'erso');
Test.assertEquals(removeChar('place'), 'lac');
  
});
