Your function takes two arguments:

current father's age (years)
current age of his son (years)
Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).






### My solution 
```
function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
  // your code here
  return   Math.abs(sonYearsOld*2-dadYearsOld)
}
```


### Another solution

```

```

describe("Sample tests", function(){
  it("Testing for dad's age: 36 and son's age: 7", function(){
    Test.assertEquals(twiceAsOld(36,7) , 22);
  });  
  it("Testing for dad's age: 55 and son's age: 30", function(){
    Test.assertEquals(twiceAsOld(55,30) , 5);
  });
  it("Testing for dad's age: 42 and son's age: 21", function(){
    Test.assertEquals(twiceAsOld(42,21) , 0);
  });
  it("Testing for dad's age: 22 and son's age: 1", function(){
    Test.assertEquals(twiceAsOld(22,1) , 20);
  });
  it("Testing for dad's age: 29 and son's age: 0", function(){
    Test.assertEquals(twiceAsOld(29,0) , 29);
  });
});
