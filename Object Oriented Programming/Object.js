/* If you think about the things people use everyday, like cars, shops, and 
shoes. These are all objects and they are tangibale

What kind of qualities do they have? A car has wheels, Shops sell items, shoes have materials

These qualities are properties, define what makes up an object. Note that 
Similar objects share the same properties, but may have different values for those properties. For example, all vehicles have wheels 
but not all vehicles the same number of wheels. 

Objects in javascript are used to model-world objects, giving them properties and behavior just like their 
real-world counterparts. Here's an example using these concepts to create 
a goat object
 */

 let goat = {
     name: "fredo", 
     numLegs = 4
 }; 
//  The goat object has two property/value pairs: a name of "fredo" and 
numLegsof 4.
