// created object, giving unexpected results

console.log(Birdie.name); //Albert
//Now Birdie has all the properties defined inside the Bird constructor

//Like any other object we can access the properties and also modify like above

/** This constructor defines a Bird object with properties name color, and numLegs
 * set to Albert, blue, and 2, respectively. 
 * 
 * Constructors follow a few conventions
 * Constructors are defined with a capitalised name to disnguish them from 
 * the other function that are not constructors. 
 * 
 * Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they 
 * will create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will 
 * create. 
 * 
 * Constructors define properties and behaviours instead of returning 
 * a value as other functions might
