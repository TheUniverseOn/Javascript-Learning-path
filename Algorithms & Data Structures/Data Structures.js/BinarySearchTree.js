/*Binary Search Tree ðŸŒ² 

 A node in BST has zero, one or two subtrees/ children. Every element in the left subtree Is lesser
 than the value of the node and every element in the right is greater than the value of the node.
 Like linked lists we just have to change the pointers when we add new elements */ 


//Best get an average case of o(log n) in gets, adds and deletes, but they can have a worst case of
//o(n) if you do something like add a sorted list to a BST.
