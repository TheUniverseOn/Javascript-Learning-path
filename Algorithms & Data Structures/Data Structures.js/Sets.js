/* A set is a collection of items that are unordered and consists of unique
elements(meaning they cannnot be repeated). This data structure uses the same math concept as 
finite sets but applied  to a  computer science data structure 

let's take a look at the math concept  of sets  before we dive into the compuuter 
science implementation of it. In mathematics, a set is a collection pd distinict objects 

For example, we have a set of natural numbers, which consists of integer numbers greater than 
or equal to 0-that  is N  = {0, 1,2,3,4,5,6, ...} The list of the objects 
within the set is surrounded by {} currely braces 

There is also the null set concept. A set with no element is called a null set or 
or an empty set. An example would be a set of prime numbers between 24 and 29. as there 
is mo prime number( a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 
1 and itself) between 24 /!; 29, the set will be empty. we will represent an empty
set with {}*/
