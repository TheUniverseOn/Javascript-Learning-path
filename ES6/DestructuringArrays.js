// Using destructuring assignment to swap the values of carDoor1 and carDoor2 so that carDoor1 receives the value stored in carDoor2, and carDoor2 receives the value stored in carDoor1.

//  Since the strict mode is applied inside the function, donâ€™t try to use const because you will get reference error, because b is not defined inside the function. 


let carDoor1 = 8, carDoor2 = 6;

console.log(carDoor1); // should be 6
